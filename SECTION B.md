JavaScript ES6 Introduces New Functionality

ES6 is the current, standardized version of JavaScript. It provides a great deal of functionality to JavaScript, allowing for more rapid development. You'll have a greater appreciation for ES6 when you compare it to the older, ES5 functionality. 

ES5 vs. ES6 Comparison Example :

In ES5, you could specify a variable with var. ES6 introduces two additional ways of specifying a variable: const and let. Below you can see an example of const: 

var x = 10;

// Here x is 10

{

  const x = 2;

  // Here x is 2

}

// Here x is 10
 

Unlike var, which has global scope unless it is wrapped in a function, const and let have block scope by default. Leveraging block scope gives you more control and will make your code more predictable in its behavior.
